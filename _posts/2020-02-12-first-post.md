## Several trials
I've tried to build blogs on many providers; Wordpress, Naver(A great search platform for South Korea), and Tistory. Those platforms are good for focusing on the blog and have big benefits. Wordpress has a powerful dash board and numerous plugins. Naver is specialized in exposing to Korean people. Tistory has a powerful design theme. I feel why not using the github page which is **free**. Until I have my domain, I can use free. Since this page is based on Jekyll, there's no other service can beat this in terms of **speed**. 

## What am I going to write? 
I want to share my programming knowledge and help people if they are stucked. I can let them out in the loop and make them see a result. My knowledge won't be valuable, but I hope that I can help. I started programming 2009 in the university. My major was the computer science. I got a lot of helps but I often gave a hand to my friends. Usually, I was a giver, not a taker.
