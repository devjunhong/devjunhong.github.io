## Several trials
I've tried to build blogs on many providers; Wordpress, Naver(A great search platform for South Korea), and Tistory. Those platforms are good for focusing on the blog and have big benefits. Wordpress has a powerful dashboard and numerous plugins. Naver is specialized in exposing to Korean people. Tistory has a powerful design theme. I feel why not using the GitHub page which is **free**. Until I have my domain, I can use free. Since this page is based on Jekyll, there's no other service that can beat this in terms of **speed**. 

## What am I going to write? 
I want to share my programming knowledge and help people if they are stuck. I can let them out in the loop and make them see a result. My knowledge will be valuable so that I can help you. I started programming in 2009 at the university. My major was computer science. I got a lot of help but I often gave a hand to my friends. Usually, I was a giver, not a taker.
