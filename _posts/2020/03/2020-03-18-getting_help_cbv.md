## Getting help about class based view 
* [Django official document](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/class-based-views/)
* [CCBV](http://ccbv.co.uk/)

The first is the Django official document. It's extremely well kept up so every update is reflected. If we wonder about mixins and class-based views, this is the document we find. 

In the CCBV, we can narrow down on the single class-based view. It means classy class-based view. We can check out what mixins are used on a specific view and easy to follow them. In addition, the method resolution order is well introduced. This feature helps to follow the Django codebase.
