### Introduction
I love to polish my skills by taking some courses at Udemy. Recently, I finished taking a course on self-coaching. The lecture is pretty short(less than an hour), and I can take it a day. It was about a self-coaching model called GROW. The acronym means; G(Goal), R(Reality), O(Options), and W(Way forward). The concept is asking you to make a measurable and specific plan as well. In each character, you need to come up with the answer. Here are some questions in the GROW model.

- G(Goal)
    - What do you want to achieve?
- R(Reality)
    - What's holding you back from solving this?
- O(Options)
    - Think of at least 5 possible solutions to solve this issue.
- W(Way forward)
    - What one small step are you going to take now/tomorrow?

I think those questions are quite obvious and easy, but I had not tried to answer them. When I tried to answer those questions, I could understand what I want to do. I want to write an English post and manage an English tech blog. Here is a small baby step to achieve my goal. Updating short articles can be the first step for me. Then, someday I hope that I can write a cool, nice, and helpful post.
