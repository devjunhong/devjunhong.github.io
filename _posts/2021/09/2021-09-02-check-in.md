  * Try to do it.. 

# Reading 
Last time I've read [the having](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Having-Secret-Feeling-Growing-Rich-ebook/dp/B07CWFBX12). The one thing from this book is not to pretent but be comfort. Feel the comfort as you become someone or try to feel comfort. In the ["Be obssessed or Be average"](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Be-Obsessed-Average-Grant-Cardone/dp/1101981059), I've found the same word. The author write down dream not using the future tense but the present. It may mean that he want to try the comfortant feeling at present instead of pushing it in the future.
