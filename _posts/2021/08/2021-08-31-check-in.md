# Reading 
Sometimes I think about a limitation. When I am a child, I didn't recognize the limitation. As growing old, I even find or excuse by using the invisible limitation. "I'm not good enough at speaking English", "I'm not good enough writing a code", or "I'm not good at playing soccer". The book [Be obsessed or Be average](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Be-Obsessed-Average-Grant-Cardone/dp/1101981059) points out that not be overwhelmed by average but embrace your freak way to success.
