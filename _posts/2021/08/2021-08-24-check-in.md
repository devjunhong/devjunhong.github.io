# Algorithm 
It is important to build a basic concept firmly. I think it's been a while I haven't take a basic course in CS. I can skip if I think I am familiar enough. There is a [github page](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) containing computer science MOOC. The best source if you want to learn computer science. 

## The goal 
The fast algorithm is that slowly grows against the size of input. We don't care when the input size is small. We are going to care when it's too large. We may not focus on the coefficient of each variable.

# LeetCode 
[Complex Number Multiplication](https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/august-leetcoding-challenge-2021/616/week-4-august-22nd-august-28th/3917/)
* Simple arithmetic Math 

# 400 Error 
* Capture the request from a client 
* Investigate Javascript code in a client side 

# K8s
There was a small session about kubernetes and I was able to set it up properly. Finally, I can access to the resource. ðŸ˜€ It's interesting that I can learn by trying.
