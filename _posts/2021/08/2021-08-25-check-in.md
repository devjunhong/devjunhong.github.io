# Algorithm 
Asymptotic analysis is suppress constant factors and lower-order terms. The constant factors are dependent on machine or compiler specific. Ignoring the lower-order term is natural. Let's say there is a formular n^2 + n. Which term will be increasing faster? n^2. See it's natural. By using the Big O notation, we can say it's O(n^2).
