# Algorithm
Counting inversions from the array. Let's say array is A. The 'Inversion' means i < j and A[i] > A[j]. For example (1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 6), there are 3 inversion pairs. (3, 2), (5, 2), (5, 4) 


# Value object
```python 
import abc

from dataclasses import dataclass


class ValueObject: 
  def __init__(self, value): 
    self.validate(value)
    self.value = value

  @abc.abstractmethod
  def validate(self, value): 
    pass


class Password(ValueObject): 
  def validate(self, value: str): 
    if not isinstance(value, str): 
      raise StrInvalidError

    if len(value) < 10:
      raise ShortPasswordError


class StrInvalidError(Exception):
  pass 


class ShortPasswordError(Exception):
  pass


@dataclass
class UserAccount:
  password: Password = Password(value=expected_password)
```
Primitive obsession is one a code smell. [article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/primitive-obsession-code-smell-hurt-people-most-arpit-jain/) It's easy to use primitive types without thinking, but we might face plenty of validation features. In that case, it's better to implement a value object. By implementing value object, we can avoid security issues. In addition, we can reuse the designed type and it increases productivity and also testability. 


# Use memory efficiently 
Python stores everything using a dictionary. Instead of keeping all, we can explicitly store the defined field by __slots__. [article](https://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/__slots__magic.html) To see the reduction of memory usage, you may need to spawn thousands of objects. But, it's worth trying. If you have a memory issue in your Python application. 
```python
class MyClass(object): 
  __slots__ = ['name', 'identifier']
  def __init__(self, name, identifier): 
    self.name = name 
    self.identifier = identifier
```
