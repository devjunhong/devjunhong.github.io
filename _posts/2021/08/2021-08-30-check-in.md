# Kafka 
Zookeeper manages failure of broker and manages synchronization issue. Run a basic example and see how to produce data and consume it. One producer can deliver a message to multiple consumers at the same time. Then, how to manage data synchronization? Obviously, the data might be processed by one consumer and it does not need to be processed in another consumer.

# 400 bad request error
Finally, I can tackle what the problem is. I was stuck on a 400 bad request error. I found a hint from this [thread](https://stackoverflow.com/a/64823918/5742992) and an old lecture that I took before. It's the problem of CORS.  

## 400 error 
I was in the exact same situation as described in the [thread](https://stackoverflow.com/a/64823918/5742992). My server responses for the request from the postman but not for my client app. So, the very first thing I'm looking for was a fetch function. But, it's not. The problem is server one. I addressed it by using the cors module in Rust. 
```rust
use actix_cors::Cors;
use actix_web::{web, App, HttpRequest, HttpServer, Result};

#[actix_web::main]
async fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
  HttpServer::new(|| {
      let cors = Cors::permissive();

      App::new()
          .wrap(cors)
          .route("/", web::get().to(greet))
          .route("/{filename:.*}", web::get().to(greet))
          .route("/api/endpoint", web::post().to(endpoint))
  })
  .bind(("127.0.0.1", 8080))?
  .run()
  .await
}
```
