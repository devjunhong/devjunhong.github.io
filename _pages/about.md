## What is your name? 

My name is "Junhong Kim". I don't have an English name. When I took a first English lecture at university, the teacher said she couldn't understand why Koreans do need an English name. We have a Korean name already. Do I need a new English name? I think no. Famous Korean stars, in particular, Heung-min Son, Hyunjin Ryu, Joonho Bong, and Yuna Kim doesn't need their English name. I'm not a famous star but my name comes from my grandfather. I'm proud that he gave me a name. That's why I don't want to create an English name. 

## Why am I write in English? 

I'm a software engineer and machine learning engineer and I have a dream working with global friends. When I'm using English, I feel that I'm being more active, outgoing, and well express myself. I know there are plenty of benefits when I use Korean. This is my personal opinion but I feel like I have two kinds of personality; speaking Korean personality and speaking English personality.

## What can I do? 
* Write code and develop useful tools in Web, Windows, and Android.
* Build a machine learning model and debugging it. 
* A lecture session about my professional knowledge.
* Write a simple tutorial.

## How do you make the blog name "Dance with Programming"? 
I have nothing in my mind when I have to name my blog. And I try to create a nice name without long consideration since I know it's hard to name on everything. 

This is not nice but that's a true story. After I name on my blog, I consider this. 

I think programming is like dancing. In my mind, I can imagine that I can dance as [BTS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzvfbRbEjww) do. In the real world, I can't dance like them. It's an illusion. I sometimes do imagine just like in this way. Every day I face someone who looks better than me in programming. If I want to do, there's no short way. I should put a lot of effort and push myself. I'm going to share a story; long, patience, hard, and pointed intended practice and repetition to be better.
